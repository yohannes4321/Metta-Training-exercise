Graph Rewriting Overview
Graph rewriting (or graph transformation) is a technique for algorithmically modifying graphs. It is widely used in software engineering, compiler optimization, model checking, visualization, and AI.

3. Graph Grammar vs. Graph Rewriting
Graph Rewriting focuses on transforming a graph from one state to another.
Graph Grammar generates all possible graphs from an initial starting graph usi
1. Core Concept of Graph Rewriting
Graph rewriting transforms an input graph into a new graph using a set of rewrite rules. Each rule consists of:

L (Pattern Graph / Left-Hand Side) – The subgraph to be matched in the original graph.
R (Replacement Graph / Right-Hand Side) – The graph that replaces the matched subgraph.
The process involves:
1. Algebraic Approaches (Category Theory-Based)
This approach relies on category theory and models graph rewriting using graph morphisms.
Pattern Matching: Finding a subgraph in the original graph that matches L.
Graph Transformation: Replacing L with R in the host graph.
Application of Constraints (if any): Labeled graphs may have additional rules to regulate transformations.

(a) Double-Pushout (DPO) Approach
A rewrite rule is defined as L ⊇ K ⊆ R, where:
L (Left): The subgraph to match in the host graph.
K (Invariant / Gluing Graph): The preserved structure that connects the modified part to the graph.
R (Right): The replacement subgraph.
Requires two pushout diagrams, ensuring that deletions only happen if all adjacent edges are removed too (avoiding dangling edges).
 Advantage: Ensures graph consistency by preventing dangling edges.
 Disadvantage: More complex due to the need for two pushout operations.

(b) Single-Pushout (SPO) Approach
A rewrite rule is simply L → R, meaning L is replaced by R.
Uses a single pushout diagram, unlike DPO.
Deleting nodes automatically removes adjacent edges.
 Advantage: Simpler than DPO.
 Disadvantage: Can leave the graph in an inconsistent state due to dangling edges.

(c) Matrix Graph Grammars
Uses Boolean algebra and matrix operations to represent and transform graphs.
Less common but useful in highly structured transformations.
 Advantage: Efficient representation using algebraic structures.
 Disadvantage: Limited practical adoption.



2. Determinate Graph Rewriting
Inspired by logic and database theory.
Treats graphs like database instances, where rewriting is like a query or view definition.
Ensures unique results (up to isomorphism) by applying all possible rules concurrently.
Advantage: Guarantees deterministic outcomes.
 Disadvantage: Less flexible due to the constraint of unique results.

3. Term Graph Rewriting
Used in compiler design, concurrency modeling, and symbolic computation.
Represents abstract syntax trees (ASTs) as term graphs and rewrites them using rules.
 Advantage: Powerful for programming language semantics and formal logic.
Disadvantage: More abstract and complex to implement compared to standard graph rewriting.

Effectiveness of Graph Rewriting Approaches
DPO is robust and prevents inconsistency but is computationally expensive.
SPO is simpler and faster but risks dangling edges.
Determinate rewriting is useful in database and logic applications but sacrifices flexibility.
Term graph rewriting is powerful in formal logic and compiler design.

2. Applications of Graph Rewriting
Compiler Optimization – Transforming code structures to improve efficiency (e.g., y = x * 2 → y = x + x).
Software Verification – Ensuring correctness of software by modeling behavior as graph transformations.
Database Query Processing – Optimizing queries by rewriting query graphs.
AI & Neural Networks – Structuring and evolving neural networks using graph transformations.
Computer Graphics & Layout Algorithms – Modifying graphical representations dynamically.
ng rewrite rules, similar to formal language grammars.
